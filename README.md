# ApocalypseGame
lil game (:

This game will be about a post-apocalyptic world where you are confined to a rover type machine. You interact with the world through an old terminal with a very slow GUI.
All the code and images are packed into the ZIP file. Use VSCode IDE to run the project, its terminal has the best text formatting and stuff.
