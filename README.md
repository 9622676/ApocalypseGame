# ApocalypseGame
lil game (:

This game will be about a post-apocalyptic world where you are confined to a rover type machine. You interact with the world through an old terminal with a very slow GUI.
All the code and images are packed into the ZIP file. Use VSCode IDE to run the project, its terminal has the best text formatting and stuff.

Version 2-0-7 is the newest.
